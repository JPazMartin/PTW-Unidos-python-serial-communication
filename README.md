# Python interface for PTW Unidos electrometer serial communication
Code for serial communication with the PTW Unidos electrometer. This code, up to now, only works using the electrometer in electrical units and charge mode.

Example `examples/basicIntegration.py` shows how to set a value of the high voltage, set the integration time of the electrometer and perform an integration.
